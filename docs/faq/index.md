# Frequently Asked Questions

## General
### Do we have any plans for increasing the player limit?
- Not a the moment. As our playerbase grows, we intend to gradually increase the resources dedicated to the server, but only to a limit that feels appropriate. 'We', being the ones responsible for the server, are only ready to increase our responsibility of the server to personal levels of preference. With that being said, we're still exploring our limits. As for the hardware resources, we're satisfied with our current workload being manageable with active number players being within the 50-100 range for reasons stated above.

### Are we interested in expanding the range of our advertisement?
- Not at the moment for reasons answered in the question prior.

### Is there a Discord server?
- Yes, there is. However, invitations are only handed out individually and personally. You may ask any moderator for an invite. While there is an #activity channel, neither your chat or commands are visible there.
