# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### Who runs the server?
The server is owned and operated exclusively by **Auzer1** and **FunOD**. There are no other moderators, admins, or staff members. If someone in-game claims they have "staff powers," they are attempting to deceive you.

### Is there an official Discord?
**No.** There is no official Discord server, nor are there plans to create one. While many player-run communities exists, none of them are moderated or sanctioned by us. We do not participate in, or take responsibility for, any external community drama.

### Is cheating/exploiting allowed?
Exploiting isn't punishable but is automatically prevented by the AntiCheat. Any exploits that bypasses the AntiCheat aren't punishable either.

### Do we have any plans for increasing the player limit?
Not at the moment. We prefer to keep the server manageable and within a resource range that we can personally oversee. Currently, we are satisfied with a 50–100 player range.

### Are we interested in expanding advertisement?
No. We prefer organic growth. The server’s direction is dictated by our personal preferences and the current hardware workload, not by a desire for a massive player count.

### Do I need the resource pack?
No. It is currently only used for testing ModelEngine entities. You can ignore it without missing out on the core gameplay experience.
