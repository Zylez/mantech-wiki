# Server Fundamentals

## Basic Information

- **Type**: Vanilla → PaperMC server with plugins  
- **IP**: `man.serveminecraft.net`  
- **Version**: 1.21.8 (24/7)  
- **Online-Mode**: OFF → Cracked clients supported  
- **World Type**: Unrestricted wilderness (build/mine/PvP everywhere)  

## Server Status

<div id="serverstatus">
    <p><b>Checking server status...</b></p>
</div>

## Core Principles

### 1. Radical Freedom  
- PvP, building, and raiding allowed EVERYWHERE  
- No safe zones or protected territories exist by default  

### 2. Ideological Tolerance  
- Extreme political/ideological views are permitted in global chat  
- **Hard boundary**: No targeting individuals with slurs, threats, or sustained harassment  

### 3. Death & Consequences  
- Inventory drops fully on death (standard behavior)  
- Griefing/theft is legal unless explicitly prevented  

## Exceptional Permissions (Rare & Personalized)

!!! note
    Granted **only** by owners for **genuine accessibility needs**, not gameplay advantage.

- **Non-faction protections**  
  - Prevents block destruction *in a limited area* (not PvP immunity)  
- **Keep-Inventory**  
  - Applies *only* to death (XP still drops)  
- **Separation Safeguards**  
  - Forced chat/world isolation during irreconcilable conflicts  
- **Limits**  
  - Players granted any of these privileges may not use them to their advantage for griefing  

!!! warning "Owner discretion only"
    No public applications. Discuss privately via DM.

## Conflict Resolution

- **Primary Method**: Chat/world isolation  
- **Third-Party Harassment**  
  - Evidence of off-server attacks (DMs, forums, etc.) = permanent cross-platform ban
