# Rewards

## About
Rewards are items and blocks that can automatically be obtained in our Minecraft server by voting on the server throughout different server-list websites. Upon doing so, the items should arrive in your inventory when you enter the server or if you're already there. Each vote on every website will grant you a unique reward(s).

## How to Vote
1. Open a website link in the list below
2. Type in the exact same username you're playing with on our Minecraft server.
3. Click Vote. Done!
